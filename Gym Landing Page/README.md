## Trainer Images

The trainer images are stored in the project folder and connected through CSS:

```css
.trainer-one {
    background-image: url("trainer1.jpg.png");
}

.trainer-two {
    background-image: url("trainer2.jpg.jpg");
}

.trainer-three {
    background-image: url("trainer3.jpg.png");
}
```

Keep the image filenames exactly the same unless you also update the CSS.

## Responsive Design

The website adapts to different screen sizes using CSS media queries.

### Desktop

The main sections use multi-column layouts for features, programs, trainers, and pricing.

### Tablet

The navigation and content layouts adjust for smaller screens.

### Mobile

The website switches to single-column layouts and reduces spacing and typography sizes for better usability.

## How to Run

1. Download or clone the repository.
2. Open the project folder in VS Code.
3. Make sure `index.html`, `style.css`, and all three trainer images are in the correct folder.
4. Open `index.html` in your browser.

For the best development experience, use the **Live Server** extension in VS Code.

## How to Upload to GitHub

Create a new GitHub repository and upload:

```text
index.html
style.css
trainer1.jpg.png
trainer2.jpg.jpg
trainer3.jpg.png
README.md
```

Make sure the image filenames match the names used in `style.css`.
